Dataset Abstract

	Since 1987, we have been monitoring populations of West Slope cutthroat trout (Onchorhyncus clarki clarki) in two standard reaches of Mack Creek in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest.  Beginning in 1993, we included monitoring of Pacific Giant Salamanders, Dicamptodon tenebrosus.  The two standard reaches are in a section of clearcut forest (ca. 1963) and an upstream 500 year old coniferous forest. Sub-reaches are sampled with 2-pass electrofishing, and all captured vertebrates are measured and weighed. This study constitutes one of the longest continuous records of salmonid populations on record.

	Study Extent Description

		Mid-elevation, third-order stream.  Gradient of 8%- 15%.  Lower 150 m is in portion clearcut in 1963, with stream gage and flume 100 m upstream of the top of the sampled section.  Upper 150 m is in 500 year-old old-growth stand dominated by Tsuga heterophylla (TSHE), Psuedotsuga menziesii (PSME), and Thuja plicata (THPL).  Study encompasses a riparian reference stand (TV010), monumented channel cross-sections (GS002), stream discharge (HF004), water chemistry (CF002), meteorology (MS001), and long-term study of in-channel wood (GS006).

Methods

	Sampling Description 

		The same 150 m reaches of stream (clearcut and old- growth) are monitored annually.  In addition to performing the population measurements on the aquatic vertebrates, a standard set of channel measurements (channel type, wetted widths and depths) are taken.


	Method Step 

		Description 

			Field Methods Methods - AS006
			The 150 m reaches are each divided into 3 contiguous 50 m reaches, which are each blocked off with nets.  Each 50 m sub-reach is then sampled with two-pass electrofishing.  All vertebrates captured are measured and weighed (note:  lengths only since 1999).  Since 1991, all cutthroat trout are also given fin clips to monitor movement between the reaches.
